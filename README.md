# CodeDraw

CodeDraw is an easy-to-use drawing library where you use code to create pictures and animations.
It is made for beginners that understand little about programming and makes it very simple to draw and animate various shapes and images to a canvas.

This is a incomplete version of CodeDraw written in .NET Framework that only works on Windows. Maybe one day Microsoft will be able to create a somewhat decent cross platform UI library.
